# Loan Approval Predictive Analytics using Gradient Boosting Classifier 

### Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of over 100,000 loan records to determine the best way to predict whether a loan applicant should be granted a loan. 

---

## Aim
The goal is to build a machine learning model that returns a unique customer ID and a loan status label, indicating whether the loan should be approved.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Accuracy at least 70%.

## Execution Instructions

### Python version 3.8.10

To create a virtual environment and install requirements for Python 3.8.10 on different operating systems, follow the instructions below:

### For Windows:

1. Open the Command Prompt by pressing Win + R, typing "cmd," and pressing Enter.
2. Change the directory to your project location:

   ```
   cd C:\path\to\project
   ```
3. Create a new virtual environment using the venv module:
   ```
   python -m venv myenv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```
5. Install project requirements using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### For Linux/Mac:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Change the directory to your project location:
   ```
   cd /path/to/project
   ```
3. Create a new virtual environment using the venv module:
   ```
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```
5. Install project requirements using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   

These instructions assume you have Python 3.8.10 installed and added to your system's PATH variable.

## Execution Instructions if Multiple Python Versions Installed

If you have multiple Python versions installed on your system and want to create a virtual environment with Python 3.8.10, you can specify the version using the Python Launcher. Follow these instructions:

### For Windows:

1. Open the Command Prompt by pressing Win + R, typing "cmd," and pressing Enter.
2. Change the directory to your project location:
   ```
   cd C:\path\to\project
   ```
3. Create a new virtual environment using the Python Launcher:
   ```
   py -3.8 -m venv myenv
   ```
   (Replace "myenv" with your desired virtual environment name.)
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   
   ```
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```
5. Install project requirements using pip:
   
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### For Linux/Mac:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Change the directory to your project location:
   ```
   cd /path/to/project
   ```
3. Create a new virtual environment using the Python Launcher:
   ```
   python3.8 -m venv myenv
   ```
   (Replace "myenv" with your desired virtual environment name.)
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```
5. Install project requirements using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

By specifying the version using `py -3.8` or `python3.8`, you ensure that the virtual environment is created using Python 3.8.10, even if you have other Python versions installed.
